      continuous tasks.</li>
    <li>I understand that this project is for research purposes only
      and not for treatment.</li>
    <li>In this project I will be required to memorise the location of
      words around a circle and indicate where on the circle that word
      was located using a computer mouse. The details of this have been
      explained in the Plain Language Statement which I have been given
      a copy to keep.</li>
    <li>I understand that there are risks involved in participating in
      this research project. Principally, postural or hand strain from

      by scheduled rest periods in the study.</li>
    <li>I understand that my participation in this project is voluntary
      and that I am free to withdraw at any time without explanation or prejudice and
      to withdraw any unprocessed data I have provided. Withdrawing from
      the project will not affect my relationship with the Melbourne
      School of Psychological Sciences. Specifically, it will not affect
      any ongoing assessment/grades or treatment that I would otherwise
      be eligible for.</li>
    <li>I have been informed that the data from this research will be
      stored at the University of Melbourne and will be destroyed five
      years from the date of the last publication arising from the

      information I provide will be safeguarded subject to any legal
      requirements; my data will be password protected and accessible

    <li>I agree to have the findings of this study emailed to me.</li>
    <li>I understand that after I sign and return this consent form,
      it will be retained by the researcher.</li>
