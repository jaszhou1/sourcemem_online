%% sourcemem-online.tex
%%
%% A manuscript for the online sequential--simultaneous version of the
%% source memory experiment.

%% sdl: I've put a lot of extra comments in here to show you what each
%% command is doing. You can feel free to remove the comments you
%% don't need any more.

%% The `documentclass` command sets up the major look and feel of the
%% document, as well as bringing in relevant commands (sections,
%% floats, etc.) for operating within that document.
%%
%% The `apa6` document class is, as you may have expected, an
%% implementation of the publication guidelines of the sixth edition
%% of the American Psychological Association. (There is a package
%% targetting the seventh edition of the publication manual, `apa7`,
%% but it is not widely available and widely tested yet.) The
%% arguments for this package are somewhat straightforward: `10pt`
%% specifies that the base font size should be 10 points; `a4paper`
%% sets the page geometry to follow an A4 size (the default is letter
%% sized paper); `man` sets the document class to output in the
%% "manuscript" style (rather than the `jou` setting, which outputs a
%% mockup of the manuscript as it would appear as a journal article).
%% This package has a fairly good set of documentation, which you
%% should consult if you need to change things, or want to explore the
%% different options.
\documentclass[10pt, a4paper, man, biblatex]{apa6} 

%% Below are the `usepackage` commands: these import packages of
%% TeX/LaTeX functionality.
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % Set the input encoding (the text of the
                            % source file) to Unicode (UTF-8).

%% Add "bibliographic resources" (i.e., BibLaTeX files).
\addbibresource{sourcemem.bib}

%% This set of commands allows plain text files to be included
%% directly in the TeX source as if it was TeX source (TeX/LaTeX can
%% be a little funny when included text as code, this bypasses that).
%% This means that tables and figures can be set up in their own
%% individual files and included in the manuscript rather than
%% copy--pasting the relevant code into manuscript document itself and
%% risking version issues.
\makeatletter % << This means that the "@" symbol will be interpreted
              %    for the following lines as being part of the command,
              %    which is usually turned off by default (to prevent
              %    people from using "system" commands.
\newcommand\primitiveinput[1] % << Define a new command.
{\@@input #1 }                % << The command body.
\makeatother                  % << Return the "@" to normal.

%% These commands are useful for drafting: they allow different
%% authors to put comments in the document at different places which
%% appear in the PDF output and (more importantly) can be searched for
%% in the LaTeX source. When compiling the final document, either
%% remove the body of the command to suppress the output on the PDF
%% or, better, fix and remove the comments.
\newcommand\jz[1]{\texttt{\small{}JZ:\@#1}}
\newcommand\afo[1]{\texttt{\small{}AFO:\@#1}}
\newcommand\sdl[1]{\texttt{\small{}SDL:\@#1}}
\newcommand\pls[1]{\texttt{\small{}PLS:\@#1}}
\newcommand\todo[1]{\texttt{\small{}TODO:\@#1}}
\newcommand\fixme[1]{\texttt{\small{}FIXME:\@#1}}

%% The bibliographic information for the manuscript. Most of this is
%% straightforward: the `apa6` document class requires authors to be
%% individually enumerated, and provides commands for different sized
%% author lists.
