  The aim of this experiment is to examine how people are able to make
  decisions from very briefly presented visual information. In
  particular, we are interested in how the limitations on attention
  and memory might prevent people from making accurate decisions when
  the number and locations of potentially important pieces of
  information changes. Although we often can feel like we see the
  world as a relatively continuous, fluid experience, however that
  experience is limited by the speed by which we can process the
  incoming visual information and capacity of our brain to operate on
  that information.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the trials in this task were easier than others: you would
  have noticed that the number of items changed from one trial to the
  next and you may have perhaps noticed that some trials were faster
  than others. By selecting different types of trials which require
  different levels of processing, and by controlling the amount of
  information available to you, we are able to examine the very limits
  of perception through examining both the number of errors that you
  made but also the speed at which you were able to respond.
</p>
<p>
  Although the experiment can be a little repetitive, we hope that in
  undertaking the experiment, you were able to reflect on the limits
  of perception and the way that, even in a very simple task, those
  limits may allow us to understand something about how the brain
  performs the complicated task of piecing together a complete picture
  of the world in everyday life.
